# Lora protocol based accident alert system for hilly terrains
## 📝Description :
Smart cities, agribusiness, automation in factories, tracking of assets, and environmental monitoring are just a few of the applications that are made possible by the marriage of IoT and LoRa. Because of its capacity to cover wide areas and go around obstacles, LoRa is perfectly suited for the installation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in isolated and challenging circumstances, such as remote areas, steep terrains, and underground constructions. This technology uses the potential of the Internet of Things to improve road safety in mountainous areas by giving drivers access to real-time data and vital information that will enable them to make educated choices	and	avoid	potential	dangers.

Sharp turns, erratic road conditions, and constrained sightlines are common in hilly terrains, making it essential for drivers to have timely warnings about obstructions or cars up ahead. Traditional safety measures, such warnings and signage on the road, haven’t been able to handle the dynamic demands of mountainous areas very well. In order to enable continuous communication and data sharing across linked devices, the integration of internet of things (IoT) systems offers a potential	solution.

* The above picture shows a vehicle come for bend, the ultrasonic sense the vehicle  presence and send the data to NodeMCU and it can send data to LoRa it communicates to another LoRa in that side, and the data send to NodeMCU and arrival of the vehicle is indicated by the red-Light traffic LED.
